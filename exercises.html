  <h1><center>TYPES OF EXERCISES</center></h1>
 <p>
  Most people tend to focus on one type of exercise or activity and think they’re<br>
   doing enough. Research has shown that it’s important to get all four types of<br>
    exercise: endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Each one has different benefits.<br>
     Doing one kind also can improve your ability to do the others, and variety helps reduce boredom and risk of injury. <br>
     No matter your age, you can find activities that meet your fitness level and needs!<br>

    <h1><a name="endurance">Endurance</a></h1>
    <p>
      Endurance activities, often referred to as aerobic, increase your breathing and heart rates.<br>
     These activities help keep you healthy, improve your fitness, and help you perform the tasks you need to do every day.<br>
      Endurance exercises improve the health of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. They also can delay or prevent many<br>
       diseases that are common in older adults such as diabetes,<br>
       colon and breast cancers, heart disease, and others. Physical activities that build endurance include:<br>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brisk walking or jogging</li>
	<li>Yard work (mowing, raking)</li>
	<li>Dancing</li>
	<li>Swimming</li>
	<li>Biking</li>
	<li>Climbing stairs or hills</li>
	<li>Playing tennis or basketball</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Increase your endurance or “staying power” to help keep up with your grandchildren during a trip to the park,<br>
   dance to your favorite songs at a family wedding, and rake the yard and bag up leaves.<br>
    Build up to at least 150 minutes of activity a week that makes you breathe hard.<br>
   Try to be active throughout your day to reach this goal and avoid sitting for long periods of time.<br>
  </p>
  <h1><a name="strength">Strength</a></h1>
  <p>
    Your muscular strength can make a big difference. Strong muscles help you stay independent and make everyday activities feel easier,<br>
     like getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, and carrying groceries. Keeping your muscles strong can help with your balance and prevent falls and fall-related injuries. <br>
     You are less likely to fall when your leg and hip muscles are strong. Some people call using weight to improve your muscle strength “strength training” or “resistance training.”<br>

Some people choose to use weights to help improve their strength. If you do, start by using light weights at first, then gradually add more. Other people use resistance bands,<br>
 stretchy elastic bands that come in varying strengths. If you are a beginner, try exercising without the band or use a light band until you are comfortable. Add a band or move on to a stronger band (or more weight)<br>
  when you can do two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions easily. Try to do strength exercises for all of your major muscle groups at least 2 days per week, but don’t exercise the same muscle group on any 2 days in a row.<br>
   Below are a few examples of strength exercises:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Lifting weights</li>
  <li>Carrying groceries</li>
  <li>Gripping a tennis ball</li>
  <li>Overhead arm curl</li>
  <li>Arm curls</li>
  <li>Wall push-ups</li>
  <li>Lifting your body weight</li>
  <li>Using a resistance band</li>
  </ul>
<h1><a name="balance">Balance</a></h1>
<p>Balance exercises help prevent falls, a common problem in older adults that<br>
   can have serious consequences. Many lower-body strength exercises also will<br>
  improve your balance.<br>
   Balance exercises include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tai Chi</li>
  <li>Standing on one foot.</li>
  <li>The heel-to-toe walk.</li>
  <li>The balance walk.</li>
  <li>Standing from a seated position.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="flexibility">Flexibility</a></h1>
<p>Stretching can improve your flexibility. Moving more freely will make it easier<br>
   for you to reach down to tie your shoes or look over your shoulder when you back<br>
    your car out of the driveway.<br>
     Flexibility exercises include:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The back stretch exercise</li>
      <li>The inner thigh stretch</li>
      <li>The ankle stretch</li>
      <li>The back of leg stretch</li>
    </ul>
